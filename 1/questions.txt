1. The data extraction depends on format of raw data (most likely it will be a binary data from stream). For the data to be conventional for our system I would parse the data into JSON. 
The size of JSON should not be a big problem as I expect data to not be cumulative. The main problem I think may be with parsing of data from many concurrent games as it may cause some overloads inside the system
